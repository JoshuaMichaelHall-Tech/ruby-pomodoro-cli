### Pull Requests

Good pull requests are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please follow these steps for your contributions:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`bundle exec rake spec`).
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines (`bundle exec rake rubocop`).
6. Create a pull request using the provided template.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec rake chmod` to ensure scripts are executable
4. Run `bundle exec rake devsetup` to set up development symlinks

### Testing

We use RSpec for testing. Please ensure all your code is tested:

```bash
# Run the entire test suite
bundle exec rake spec

# Run specific tests
bundle exec rspec spec/lib/pomodoro_timer_spec.rb
```

### Style Guidelines

We follow the Ruby style guide and use Rubocop for style enforcement:

```bash
# Check code style
bundle exec rake rubocop

# Auto-correct certain issues
bundle exec rubocop -a
```
